# Music Radio

A website that can generate 10 popular music at random

## About the Website 

This website will display a fullscreen image of the album cover or artist(s). A text of the radio station will appear on top of the window and right under it will be the genre of the music. Towards the bottom of the page will be the song title which will be floating horizontally in and out of the screen. Right under that text is the name of the artist and below the name of the artist is the album name. 

There are 2 buttons, one is Random and the other is Pause/Play. The Random button will play a new song out of random and the Pause/Play button will allow the user to pause the music that is playing or play it if it is paused.

This project was done in collaboration with a colleague of mine in Per Scholas. We worked together to make sure everything was fully functional.
